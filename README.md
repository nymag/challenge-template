# challenge-template

This repo contains the same directory structure and NPM dependencies as the repo we will ask you to pull down and work through in the coding portion of the technical interview.

In advance of the interview, please take a moment to pull down this repo, install dependencies, and make sure you are able to run the application locally (`npm run start`). To confirm this, you can visit `http://localhost:3002/`. This will let us minimize the time in the interview spent debugging local setup :upside_down_face: 

In the event that you have difficulty getting the application running locally, you can simply let your interviewer know at the beginning of the interview session, and we'll make the appropriate accomodations.
